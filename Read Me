  Our website is based on the store La Petite Boutique in Jackson, TN. Her store is very cute and girly and that is how we made our website.
We wanted to make a website that showed the characteristics of her store and show off her girly quality.  
Our experiences were really good with this website. We enjoyed learning how to code. Learning was very easy surprisingly.

We tried really hard to get our website to open up correctly but it does not want to work. You might have to download it to be able to view the website.We are so sorry  for the trouble.
